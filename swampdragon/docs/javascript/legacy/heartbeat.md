# Heartbeat implementation

Sometimes it's useful to implement a heartbeat (for instance if you implement your own authentication solution)

To enable heartbeats add ```SWAMP_DRAGON_HEARTBEAT_ENABLED = True``` to settings.py.

**Note** that heartbeats need to be enabled for session refresh to work.


## JavaScript

If you want to perform a custom action in JavaScript for each heartbeat, implement the ```onHeartbeat``` function

    $dragon.onHeartbeat(function() {
        console.log('heartbeat');
    });


## Custom connection

If you have a custom connection and want to execute some code on each beat, override ```on_heartbeat```.
 
    def on_heartbeat(self):
        super().on_heartbeat()
        # Your functionality here

**Note** that if you don't call ```super``` on the heartbeat the session keys will not refresh 
(this is only relevant if you use sessions)
