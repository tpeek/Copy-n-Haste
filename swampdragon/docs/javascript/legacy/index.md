# JavaScript (pre version 0.4.0)

SwampDragon comes with an AngularJS service and directives, but it works just as well with other JavaScript libraries, or in fact, no library at all.

For AngularJS see [SwampDragon and AngularJS](/documentation/angularjs-and-swampdragon/).

There are 4 callbacks that can be passed as parameters when instantiating SwampDragon.
 
*  ```onopen```
*  ```onmessage```
*  ```onchannelmessage```
*  ```onclose```

The minium required script includes to use SwampDragon 

    <!-- Swamp dragon -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}swampdragon/js/vendor/sockjs-0.3.4.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}swampdragon/js/swampdragon.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}swampdragon/js/datamapper.js"></script>

If you are using ```ModelRouter``` or ```ModelPublisherRouter``` it's recommended to include the DataMapper as well.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}swampdragon/js/datamapper.js"></script>


A vanilla JavaScript wrapper was added as of version 0.3.8 to avoid the awkward callback setup

    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}swampdragon/js/swampdragon-vanilla.js"></script>


## Creating a connection

        function onOpen() { ... }
        function onMessage() { ... }
        function onChannelMessage() { ... }
        function onClose() { ... }

        var swampDragon = new SwampDragon({
            onopen: onOpen,
            onmessage: onMessage,
            onchannelmessage: onChannelMessage,
            onclose: onClose
        });

        swampDragon.connect('http://' + window.location.hostname + ':9999', 'data')

Note that once ```new SwampDragon(...)``` is called, it will assign an instance to ```window.swampDragon``` so there is no need to do this manually.

See documentation on [callbacks](/documentation/javascript-callbacks/)
