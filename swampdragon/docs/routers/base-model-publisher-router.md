# ModelPubRouter

The ```ModelPubRouter``` is similar to ```ModelRouter``` with one exceptions:
the ModelPublisherRouter will publish data when a CRUD function is invoked on the router.

This router is a good option when self-publishing models are not used.
Since a self-publishing model will publish it self when it's changed, this could result in duplicate updates.

If a model shouldn't be published unless certain criteria is met, it's better to use the ModelPublisherRouter.

Override the ```created```, ```updated``` and/or ```deleted``` function to handle the data being published.

The benefits of using the ```ModelPubRouter``` instead of making every model a self-publishing model is 
to have control over the publishing process.

In the following scenario we only publish models that have a specific rating:

    class FooRouter(ModelPubRouter):
        model = Foo
        serializer_class = FooSerializer
        
        def updated(self, obj, **kwargs):
            if obj.rating < 3:
                return; # We don't publish this model because the rating is too low
            super().updated(obj, **kwargs)
            
        def created(self, obj, **kwargs):
            return # We don't want to publish this model when it's created because the rating is too low
            
            
If the Foo model was simply a self publishing model it would have published the update.
This way we can ensure that only Foo instances with a rating over 3 is posted
