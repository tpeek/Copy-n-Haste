# BaseRouter

The base router is a good place to start when building anything that isn't directly related to a model or a serializer.

A router consists of a series of verbs, which are user defined functions.

A function should finish by calling either ```send``` or ```send_error```.

    class FooRouter(BaseRouter):
        route_name = 'foo'
        valid_verbs = ['get_date']
    
        def get_date(self, **kwargs):
            self.send({'current_date': str(datetime.now())})
                    
            
    route_handler.register(FooRouter)
