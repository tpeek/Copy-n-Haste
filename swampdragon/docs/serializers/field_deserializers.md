# Field deserializers

Create a file and name it ```field_deserializers.py```.
This file needs to reside inside an app ```app/field_deserializers.py```.

Extend ```BaseFieldDeserializer```

The following example will append the word 'foo' to every CharField

    from swampdragon.serializers.field_deserializers import BaseFieldDeserializer, register_field_deserializer
    

    class FooDeserializer(BaseFieldDeserializer):
        def __call__(self, model_instance, key, val):
            deserialized_val = 'foo {}'.format(val)
            setattr(model_instance, key, deserialized_val)
            
            
    register_field_deserializer('CharField', FileDeserializer)


Register the deserializer by adding a string representation of the field type along with the serializer.

        register_field_deserializer('CharField', FileDeserializer)
